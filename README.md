Gomoku is a strategy board game which is also called Five in a Row. 

## Description

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

## My Extra Bonus Feature

There are a couple of features in my app that warrant the additonal 1 mark.

1) The player has the option of 3 grid sizes which they can change at any time by clicking on the 'Change Grid Size' button underneath the reset button
2) The banner colour which indicates the current players turn, changes to match the colour of the player's square
